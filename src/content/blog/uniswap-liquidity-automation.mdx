Over the past year at BoxExchanger I have been building an automated liquidity system that keeps Uniswap V3 positions profitable without a human on-call for every price move.

## Architecture

- **Watcher** Lambda listens to pool swaps and triggers rebalances when volatility exceeds a configurable delta.
- **Planner** service computes the optimal tick ranges using historic volatility bands and pool depth sensitivity.
- **Executor** signs and submits transactions through a custodial signer, broadcasting safe fallback instructions when gas spikes.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Deterministic math** beats ad-hoc heuristics—encode everything as pure functions and keep floating point out of smart-contract facing code.
2. **Telemetry-first** meant we could see ROI drifts in Grafana and course-correct before LPs felt pain.
3. **Simulation harnesses** that replay the last 72h of swaps saved countless incidents.

Next up: exposing LP performance snapshots via a lightweight GraphQL API.
