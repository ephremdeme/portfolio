AffCollect ingests thousands of affiliate dashboards every hour. We shifted the pipeline from cron-based polling to an event-driven graph built on Kafka + AWS Lambda.

## Ingredients

- **Orchestrator** topics manage fetch → normalize → enrich jobs.
- **Lambda shards** keep third-party API quotas respected via token buckets.
- **DynamoDB stream** fans out incremental updates to downstream billing services.

## Outcomes

- 10x faster ingestion with concurrency controls.
- 99%+ accuracy because retries are isolated per merchant stream.
- Observability by default using OpenTelemetry into Honeycomb.

This playbook now powers every data workload I touch.
